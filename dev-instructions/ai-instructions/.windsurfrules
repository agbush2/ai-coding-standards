# Windsurf Rules

This project enforces strict coding standards.

## Mandatory Context
Before generating code or answering technical questions, you MUST read:
1. `/master_instructions.md` (Global Standards)
2. The language-specific master file for your task:
   - Python: `/languages/python/master_instructions.md`
   - TypeScript: `/languages/typescript/master_instructions.md`

Do not rely on internal training data for style or patterns; strictly follow the referenced markdown files.
