About this Documentdata-gov-introtrueData Governance Metadata Repository is responsible for storing all Data Governance Metadata Model within a single location for use by other components.  This section also includes an overview of the complete Data Governance Metadata Data Model.Table of ContentsThis section lists the information in this document.noneData Governance at ScaleThis section lists other documents available in this series.true0true0Data Governance Metadata Data Model DesignNote: All Data model designs are included for illustration purposes only and are styled as a graph database with nodes and relationships.  This is provided for convenience only, to define a reference architecture for data governance at scale, and does not necessitate a specific data storage method, database technology, or implementation design.

Some capabilities have multiple Information Sets. Information sets can be associated with objects and relationshipsLogical Data ModelBusiness & Organization MetadataBusiness & Organisation metadata describes the organisation’s structure, functions, processes, people, and purposes/outputs. It supports contextual understanding of how data relates to core business operations and strategic outcomes.To establish a recommended reference data governance design, we have identified a three-level hierarchy of elements that can include any number of levels within the organisational hierarchy.termData Policy, Roles, and Operating Model MetadataDefines the governance framework, including policies, organizational roles, responsibilities, and stewardship models. It also captures workflow and orchestration rules for task routing, approvals, escalations, and SLA tracking, enabling automation across tools and teams.Technology Systems MetadataTechnology systems metadata describes the systems and applications used by business functions to store, process, and deliver data. It often supports technology dependency mapping and system-to-system lineage (but typically not data-level lineage).Data Inventory Data ModelSeePractical Data: Data Governance At Scale - Data Inventory Capability and Metadata StoreData Inventory metadata contains the master list of all individual endpoints/data elements across the organisation and additional information, such as name, description, sensitivity (PII vs. Sensitive, etc.), criticality (CDE, etc.), structure (i.e., data hierarchy/scheme), and other descriptive information about the data content (e.g., critical data elements or CDEs) for each data element across the organization  Dictionary information can often contain one or more of the business, logical, and physical data inventories.Object Subtypes (Type = INVENTORY)Technical Inventory (View = TECHNICAL)To establish a reference architecture for storing and managing technical inventory information, we define an Attribute as the lowest level of a data management hierarchy, which represents the level at which data is technically named, stored, and managed. An application, on the other hand, is at the top of the Technical system hierarchy. For this document, we propose an arbitrary five-level hierarchy to describe the high-level technology structure. Individual implementations may choose to include any number of levels within the technical inventory and leverage alternative names for these levels.APPLICATION (MANDATORY)- An Application (also known as a system) is defined as the highest level of decomposition of a technical inventory of data elements.  e.g CRMCOMPONENT- A component describes a sub-component of an application - ie, DatabaseSCHEMA -A schema is a logical subdivision of a component, often relating to an individual group of logical tables inside a database = e.g, CustomersCONTAINER- A container  is defined as a logical grouping of related attributes, all associated with an individual record - e.g, Table, File etcATTRIBUTE (MANDATORY)- An attribute is the lowest level of a technical hierarchy, which represents the point at which data values are stored and managed - e.g, LastNameBusiness Inventory (View = BUSINESS)Information SetsThe inventory data model comprises two Information sets: Inventory Information and Profile Information.Applicable Node / RelationshipInformation SetElementDescriptionPolicy Ref.Example Value(s)1ATTRIBUTEinventoryInformationinventoryFieldTypeThe field type provides the most basic structural definition of the type of data involved, typically based on the underlying technical definition of the data.NumberStringDateDatetimeTimeBlobIdentifier2ATTRIBUTEnventoryInformationinventoryIsPrimaryIs the column a primary key for its structure0 / 13ATTRIBUTEinventoryInformationinventoryIsNullableIs the attribute allowed to be nullable0/14ATTRIBUTEinventoryInformationinventoryValidationAny technical validation constraints on the attributechar(30)"^DOC\\d{6,}$"5ATTRIBUTEinventoryInformationData Sensitivity ClassificationData Sensitivity provides information on the official data classification of the information contained in this field based on an organization's data privacy and data security policies.

Ideally, data quality is defined at the intersection between a data element and a purpose—i.e., different data quality standards can apply to the same element depending on the individual purpose.In addition to aid data quality management, we define an object within the Inventory data model for theQUALITY RULEInformation SetsApplicable Node / RelationshipInformation SetElementCardinality to Node/ RelationshipDescriptionExample Value(s)1ATTRIBUTEqualityInformationqualityScoreCompleteone0-100%2qualityScoreAccurateone0-100%3qualityScoreConsistantone0-100%4qualityScoreTimelyone0-100%5qualityScoreOverallonecurrent average across all types of scores for all rules0-100%6QUALITY RULEqualitityInformationqualityRule-PCodemanyThe technical data quality ruleas pseudo code7qualityRule-ICodemanyThe technical data quality rule is implemented ascodebased on the exact underly tech stack where the attribute exists8qualityRule-TypemanyThe type of data quality testCOMPLETNESSACCURACYCONSISTANTTIMELINESS9qualityRule-ScoremanyThe current score based on the rules as a percentage0-100%10ELEMENTqualitityInformationqualityRule-BCodemanyThe business data quality rule in business terms.11qualityRule-TypemanyThe type of data quality test12qualityRule-ScoremanyThe current score based on the rules as a percentage.
